Arduno ATTint85 chip gives you 4 x 100char memories, iambic a, b and ultic
also provides a training program.  All this on a chip costing < Â£2!

I have put this is a small case and added 10pF capacitors to all the socket pins to ground ( and button) to stop stray RF.  Initially, this just used a MODFET 2N7000 to switch low the keying line however I do have a old Hybrid transceiver (TS530SP) which needs to key the -75V screen grid.   I added that by using a high-voltage PNP transistor and used diodes to block the two keying outputs from each other.  This has been tested and works a treat and saves on the expense of a solid-state relay.

Also run it off the 13.5V radio supplies though an LM7805.
